# VR: Where Are They Now, With filipv

Filipv, our very own JB wunderkind and the fellow that onboarded me into such a welcoming and brilliant community, made the grave error of agreeing to record himself playing VR miniature golf with me the other day. This resulted in shenanigans, as one might expect, but it also gave us a glimpse into the recent happenings filipv has been engaged with.

### Filipv: where is he now?

Filipv is still comfortably engaged with JB initiatives around governance, populating the YouTube channel, and serving as MC for town hall’s, among many other things. You can find filipv in the general chat always helping out, or across the discord helping to craft and curate threads and proposals as needed. It was his invisible hand that guided this very article into the ether that is our web3 blog.

On the heels of an engaging discussion that took place in the after-party of the last JB town hall, I also decided to ask filipv some pointed questions about his feelings on mayonnaise. His answers, as you may expect, did not disappoint.

And finally and perhaps most importantly, filipv announced that he is working on his very own NFT music project. It’s all very hush hush at the moment, but he looks forward to sharing more when the time is right.

### The Horse’s Mouth

If you’d like to delve further into any of the revelations above, please find a carefully curated video of filipv being interviewed about his ambitions, his mic technique, and mayonnaise. He didn’t end up winning the golf game, but he’s clearly winning at life. And please excuse the awful audio— my mic technique is nothing to write home about. Enjoy!
