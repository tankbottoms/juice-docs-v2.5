# Juicebox in the words of: DrGorilla

*“Juicebox in the words of” is a series that highlights JB community members in interview form. Learn about members’ roles at JB and what makes them tick.*

*DrGorilla is a contributor to the JB space on the dev side. By all accounts a deft coder, what most people will really tell you is how fucking funny he is. I stand with many when I say that I feel like he’s a comedian moonlighting as a coder. After all, comedy never pays the bills. Read on to learn a bit more about his passions, history at JB, and eclectic former jobs— one of which traces back over 500 years!*

### How'd you get started with JB, and how has it changed since you've been here?

It all started in November, when nicholas reached out to tell me that JB was looking for devs. I joined immediately. I had left previous projects because they were either running in circle or became cash-grabs, so I was looking for something more interesting (for a solidity dev) to do. I joined the Discord the same day nicholas reached out and wrote my first batch of unit tests the same night!

This period was in-between ConstitutionDAO and AssangeDAO, so we were in some kind of a wave of newcomers to JuiceboxDAO. Since then, Juicebox and JuiceboxDAO have been maturing a lot, in terms of governance, tech, identity (and there are so many cool things yet to come) :)

### That's such an awesome origin story. One thing that has struck me is how open and inclusive people are at JB; I haven't encountered a single asshole yet. Where are they?

… Not in JuiceboxDAO.
All in all, this is a great contributors team, and a super diverse community around, really a nice place!

### What is something people here in JB would be surprised to learn about you? Ie interesting hobbies/life experiences etc?

Ok, tricky to not doxx myself too much… Maybe a list of professions and jobs I might—or might not :)—have done:
Waiter
Morgue janitor
Photo-assistant
MD & surgical resident
Finance master & gintonic producer
Art degree & real author of the Vitruvian man

### lol! Omg that’s some eclectic shit! Tell me about what it was like cleaning up the morgue!

... Cold haha. But clean (not the cleanest part of my professional cleaning career, but certainly the most atypical one:)
I was a teenager, so a bit afraid the first time, but humans are super resilient, I got along with it:)

### How many ghosts did you bump into? Did a door ever slam shut across the hall in an otherwise empty building?

Those guys were really nice as to mark the empty/occupied "rooms" (that was a small morgue, not like the ones with shelfs as in movies, rather one small refrigerated room per body), but still, it happened to bumped into someone (who obviously didn't care being bothered anymore).

I remember one of the full-time (adult) janitor having this sentence I'll never forget: "You should rather be scared of the people alive", adding paranoia to my already existing ptsd.

### **lol**

...

### Ok, we will do a follow-up article just about this topic, but let's forge on back to nicer topics.

“DrGorilla’s Morgue Experience!” - yeah, rather morbid.

### Between you and me and the internet, who is your favorite JB contributor, and why is it Zom_Bae?

Because she rocks! Nobody’s expecting a Zom_Bae, yet, she appears to solve stuff, and that’s pretty cool imo.

### You know she singled you out when she was asked who her favorite contributor was.

“My favorite contributor is Felixander because he makes me look good on paper.”

### Perfect, best answer so far! OK, tell me what the future of DrGorilla looks like. What are you really excited about?

Lately, I've been like deep into V2 final push, so this is my "scope" when answering that I'm really excited about starting coding treasury extensions (imagine strats à la Yearn, but as a DAO on Juicebox!) - nerdy-side aside, this is gonna rock!

### Haha, that's the perfect answer for a JB contributor! Your heart is in the right place!

My heart and my keyboard : )

### We will do a follow-up about your morgue days and so much more, but for now I will ask one last question: whats the silliest thing you've ever done (beside this interview)?

This is a tough one! Nothing beats this interview.
