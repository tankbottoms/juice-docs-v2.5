# Delegate

#### What everyone needs to know

- A delegate contract is a way of providing extensions to a treasury that augments the default [`JBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal`](/dev/api/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/README.md) behavior.
- Pay delegates include a custom `didPay(...)` hook that will execute after all of the default protocol pay logic has successfully executed in the terminal contract. The hook is passed a bunch of contextual information via a [`JBDidPayData`](/dev/api/data-structures/jbdidpaydata.md) data structure.
- Redemption delegates include a custom `didRedeem(...)` hook that will execute after all of the default protocol redeem logic has successfully executed in the terminal contract. The hook is passed a bunch of contextual information via a [`JBDidRedeemData`](/dev/api/data-structures/jbdidredeemdata.md) data structure. The `didRedeem(...)` hook gets called before any reclaimed tokens are transferred out of the terminal contract.
- Each [`IJBPaymentTerminal`](/dev/api/interfaces/ijbpaymentterminal.md) fork can leverage delegates in unique ways.

#### What you'll want to know if you're building

- There are two types of delegates: [`IJBPayDelegate`](/dev/api/interfaces/ijbpaydelegate.md)s and [`IJBRedemptionDelegate`](/dev/api/interfaces/ijbredemptiondelegate.md)s. Any contract that adheres to these interfaces can be used as a delegate in a project's funding cycles.
- Delegate contracts to use should be specified by the funding cycle's [`dataSource`](data-source.md).
- The [`IJBPayDelegate`](/dev/api/interfaces/ijbpaydelegate.md)'s `didPay(...)` hook is triggered in [`JBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal._pay(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/write/-_pay.md), and the [`IJBRedemptionDelegate`](/dev/api/interfaces/ijbredemptiondelegate.md)'s `didRedeem(...)` hook is triggered in [`JBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal.redeemTokensOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/write/redeemtokensof.md).
- The redemption delegate hook is called before funds are dispersed.
