# Overflow

#### What everyone needs to know

* A project can set distribution limits from its treasury on a per funding cycle basis using [`JBController.launchProjectFor(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/write/launchprojectfor.md) and [`JBController.reconfigureFundingCyclesOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/write/reconfigurefundingcyclesof.md). These limits are stored in [`JBController.distributionLimitOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/read/distributionlimitof.md). Any funds that are in the project's Juicebox treasury that it hasn't specified as distributable are considered overflow.
* Overflow serves as a project's runway since future funding cycles can tap into it within the bounds of the preconfigured distribution limits. Overflow can also serve as a refund or rebate mechanism, where everyone's net contribution price is pushed towards zero as volume outpaces what the project needs. 
* By default, overflow also serves a means for allowing community members to exit with a portion of the treasury's funds in hand. Any funds in overflow are reclaimable by the project's community by redeeming community tokens along a bonding curve defined by the project's current [redemption rate](redemption-rate.md). Projects can override or extend this functionality using a custom [data source](data-source.md).
* Projects can manage how much money is in overflow (and therefore how much each member can exit with) either by adjusting its distribution limits or by using a custom redemption extension.
* A project can set overflow allowances from its treasury on a per-funding-cycle-configuration basis within the [`JBController.launchProjectFor(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/write/launchprojectfor.md) and [`JBController.reconfigureFundingCyclesOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/write/reconfigurefundingcyclesof.md) transactions. These allowances are stored in [`JBController.overflowAllowancesOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/read/overflowallowanceof.md). A project's owner can distribute the project's funds from its overflow on-demand up until the preconfigured allowance. Overflow allowances do not reset each funding cycle, they last until a new funding cycle reconfiguration takes effect.
