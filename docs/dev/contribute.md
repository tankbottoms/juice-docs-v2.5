Interested in contributing to the Juicebox ecosystem?

Check out the [Notion task manager](https://juicebox.notion.site/Workspace-1d90d66410c243f2ac9074d1545e23e3) to see which gigs are immediately available. Developers can also peruse the [Juicebox public repos](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/) to see open issues.

If you feel you have something to offer that isn't outlined here, reach out to the community [on Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox) in the #general channel, or the working channel relevant to your skills.

Anyone can make a proposal to get paid out from the JuiceboxDAO treasury, voted on by JBX votes according to the DAO's [governance process](/dao/process.md).
