# How to Contribute

## A Permeable DAO

JuiceboxDAO strives to maintain an open contribution policy. Anyone may pitch in and help with any of the Focus Areas defined in the DAO Foundation, such as protocol and frontend development, community alignment, and governance. 

Unlike traditional workplaces, the DAO is open to pseudonymous contributors ("anons"). New contributors are not expected to present a resumé or any other identifying material. The DAOs permeability to new contributors with no substantial reputation informs its contributor onboarding structure. 

To welcome new contributors, many of whom have little to no reputation online, the DAO suggests that contributors consider the following process to successfully onboard as a paid contributor

## How can I start contributing to Juicebox DAO?

If you’re looking for ways to get started, check the [tasks database](https://www.notion.so/7508d91f38ef4901b5e175ed95b42bf4). This page functions as a “to-do list” for the DAO, keeping track of future goals and tasks that are in-progress. If you have a contribution idea that isn’t already in the database, feel free to either add it yourself or send a message in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox).

## How can I get rewarded as a new contributor?

Once you have made some contributions, the next step is to submit a proposal for a Payout Trial Period in the [proposals database](https://www.notion.so/9d126f9148dc42ee83317d5cd74e4db4). These proposals are typically payments of $300-600 for 1-3 cycles, used to gauge contributor fit with the DAO. For more information on making a proposal, look at [How to Make a Governance Proposal](proposals.md).

## How can I advance to recurring payouts?

Once you have completed a Payout Trial Period, it is recommended that you fill out a Recurring Payment template in the [](https://www.notion.so/9d126f9148dc42ee83317d5cd74e4db4) database. This template will ask you to explain what you have done so far and how you plan to contribute to the community going forward. It is encouraged for recurring payouts to be renewed/updated every 90 days.

## What should I do next

1. Join [the Discord](https://www.discord.gg/juicebox).
2. Join the weekly Town Halls if possible (Tuesday 22:00 UTC).
3. Read the most recent cycle of governance proposals (or more, if you are able).
4. Read the recent message history in relevant Discord channels to familiarize yourself with the high level ongoing projects in the DAO, and details of the areas you wish to contribute to. 
5. Reach out to active contributors in the channels related to work you’d like to help contribute. Ask what you can help on or propose a new work action.
6. Participate in the DAO for 1-2 weeks before asking for a payout.
7. Write a governance proposal for a Trial Payout (see recent trial payout proposals to size the payout). See *[How to Make a Governance Proposal](proposals.md)*.
8. If you would like to continue after the initial trial payout period, write another trial payout proposal, or a recurring payout proposal. You may want to talk with other contributors first to feel out which makes sense.

*Note: In order to get paid by Juicebox DAO, you will need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. You can read more about wallets [here](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/).*
