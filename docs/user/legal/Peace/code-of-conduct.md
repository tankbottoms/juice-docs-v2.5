The DAO reserves the right to remove prospective Stewards at any stage of the DAO Stewards’ program in the event of breach of Code of Conduct or any applicable terms and conditions.

Views, statements and opinions expressed by DAO Stewards do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the DAO Association or any of its affiliated entities, and shall be considered individual and personal statements of the selected candidate.

Any behaviour contrary to this spirit of tolerance is unacceptable and those acting contrary to this spirit of tolerance will be immediately excluded from the Steward Program and prevented from assuming any and all privileges granted to DAO Stewards.
