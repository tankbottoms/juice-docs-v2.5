# ☮️ PeaceDAO Guiding Principles

#### Definitions.

-   [Definitions](./definitions.md)

#### Introduction.

These guiding principles constitute an Agreement **(hereinafter the "Agreement")** and are entered into by and amongst members of **PeaceDAO (hereinafter “DAO” or “☮️DAO”)**, an unincorporated nonprofit association organized under the laws of the **State of Delaware.**

The following terms apply when you click to view or access DAO's Dapp or DAO's online services **(including https://peace.move.xyz)**, donate cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, or transfer one or more **ERC-20 ("Tokens")** or **ERC-721 ("NFTs")** **("Cryptographic currencies")** to the DAO, become a Member of DAO, receive DAO Tokens, hold Governance Rights for the DAO, interact with or access [the DAO's smart contracts in any way](./contract-addresses), provide services to the DAO, donate or transfer any property to the DAO, or otherwise interact with or access the DAO's services through the Dapp. Participating in the DAO's governance may occur on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org), however for the purpose of this agreement we refer to this as part of the DAO Dapp.

**By doing any of the above, you signify your agreement to these terms. If you do not agree to be bound by the Agreement in its entirety, you may not access, interact with, or use the DAO Dapp or online services. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings ascribed to them in Section 17.**

#### 1. Organization.

> **(a) Formation.** The DAO was formed on March 15, 2021. The obligations of members of the DAO shall be determined pursuant to the Delaware Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, §§ 1901-1916 inclusive, and this Agreement.

#### Purpose.

Peace DAO's purpose is to fund life-saving assistance and support for refugees of war and internally displaced people. The following is an initial framework for the governance of Peace DAO, the execution of funding initiatives, and the management of Peace DAO’s treasury.

> The DAO is an unincorporated association of individuals, corporations, statutory trusts, business trusts, estates, trusts, partnerships, limited liability companies, associations, joint ventures, or any other legal or commercial entity, many, if not all, of whom agree to join together for a common, nonprofit purpose. For the DAO, that purpose is encapsulated in its mission statement.

> The DAO is not intended to be or become an entity required to register as an “investment company” as defined in Section3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

#### 2. Membership; Governance Rights and Tokens; Limitations.

> **(a) Governance Rights.** Governance Rights in the DAO are represented by Project Tokens, with each Token representing a fractional part of the Governance Rights of all Members (or assignees, as the case may be) equal to the quotient of one (1) divided by the total number of Tokens claimed at any time.

> **(b) Tokens.** As of the date hereof, there shall be an allowance of up to the max of an unsigned integer 2<sup>256-1</sup>[^1], tokens authorized to represent membership interests in the DAO, unless otherwise agreed to and by the Members via a vote occurring through the Dapp. Membership in the DAO, as defined bey Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 1901, shall be voluntary and open to any individual whose purpose or presumed intent is to contribute to the DAO and is willing to accept responsibilities and terms of membership. The DAO shall grant the initial Member's governance voting tokens proportional to contributions to the Gnosis multi-signature wallet[^2].

> Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the DAO may provide initial members Tokens for their role in conceiving and supporting the DAO. [continued](./tokens.md)

> **(c) Limitation to the DAO Protocol Configuration.** The DAO shall not configure the Juicebox Protocol where the Reserved Tokens is undefined or 0%, the Redemption Rate allows for 100%, and the Discount Rate with any value other than zero (0%). The DAO shall not allow the Juicebox Protocol initial Token Issuance with any parameters where the Token Redemption Rate is greater than the capital required to purchase the Tokens.

> **(d) Admission.** The DAO is a decentralized network of members and may admit or deny individuals for any arbitrary purpose or lack of purpose.

All of the DAO governing members shall have their membership determined upon receipt of voting tokens acquired on a public blockchain via the DAO's Juicebox Project management page (“Cryptographic Units”, and such holders, “Members”). Cryptographic Units are used for participating in and improving the governance of the DAO through affirmative votes effectuted via the Designated Smart Contract (defined herein) (such process, “Cryptographic Consensus”) or more commonly, Snapshot the popular off-chain voting protocol ("Snapshot"). Once the DAO admission requirements are met a prospective Member may be put up to a vote of the full membership. The DAO will consistently review, and if necessary, Members may make adjustments to the DAO admission requirements based on their evolving needs and as registered in a successful vote through the Designated Smart Contract. Notwithstanding, the DAO may admit all individuals who hold the DAO token by capturing an inventory of all current holders and ratifying the membership at Governance intervals from time to time.

> **(e) Token Liquidity Pools.** The DAO shall not create any Liquidity Pools.

> **(f) Governance Rights and Token Limitations.** Governance Rights and the governance Tokens provide no possibility of profits and losses, no rights to distributions and dividends, and no rights to ownership or management of the DAO. Each Member (or assignees, as the case may be) that receives or holds governance Tokens expressly and unequivocally agrees that the Tokens provide no rights to profits and/or losses, that the Tokens do not entitle their holder to distributions or dividends, and that the Tokens do not make their holder an owner or manager of the DAO.

> **(g) Token Reserved Rate.** Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, contributors to the DAO shall be entitled to receive Reserved Rate Tokens by a vote of the Members, via the Reserved Tokens list, as defined by the Juicebox Protocol configuration. Each Member expressly and unequivocally agrees to 2(f) above.

> **(h) Responsibilities.** As of the date hereof, Members are not required to submit to any dues or membership fees. However, in the event the Members otherwise agree via a vote occurring through the Dapp or Snapshot, each Member shall keep reasonably current in payment of any dues or membership fees and other financial obligations of membership, if applicable and determined by the DAO. Each Member shall notify the DAO of a Discord, Twitter, or other acceptable communication channel by which such Member may receive written or electronic materials required or permitted by this document or shall notify the DAO that such Member lacks the standard acceptable addresses and designate a mutually acceptable form of communication.

> > If you have received any Tokens or are otherwise a Member, you consent and agree to become legally bound by this Agreement as both a participant in the DAO and more specifically a DAO "Member".

> **(i) Information Rights.** Members shall have access to all information concerning operational and financial affairs of the DAO via

> > **Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet Etherscan Mainnet** `0xD2427c0e44D28Ea74c0504E072c6073d135569B2`,

> > **Ethereum Block Explorer** `https://etherscan.io/address/0xD2427c0e44D28Ea74c0504E072c6073d135569B2`,

> > **Juicebox's Project Page** `https://juicebox.money/p/peace`, and

> > **Snapshot** `https://snapshot.org/#/peace.movedao.eth`.

#### 3. Liability.

> **(a) No Member Liability.** Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Act, no Member (or former Member) shall be personally liable for the obligations of the DAO, including any obligations owed by any such Member in connection with any breach of this Agreement. A debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO is solely the debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO. Members (or former Members) are not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO solely by reason of being or acting as a Member or acting on behalf of the DAO. The failure of the DAO to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not grounds for imposing liability on a Member of the DAO for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO.

> **(b) Member Limitations.** No Member shall have the right or power:

> > **(i)** to cause the dissolution and winding up of the DAO; or

> > **(ii)** to demand or receive property, including any ERC-20 or ERC-721 Tokens ("Cryptocurrency assets") donated to the DAO, except as agreed to by the Members or otherwise provided herein.

#### 4. Admission of Additional Members.

> **(a)** Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Members are authorized to accept additional donations from one or more Members, and to admit other Persons to the DAO as additional Members (each such additional Member and such existing Member is an "Additional Member"). Unless otherwise determined by the Members, any such Additional Members shall be admitted to the DAO only if such Member or Additional Member makes a donation via the Dapp.

> **(b) Accession to Agreement.** Each Person who is to be admitted as an Additional Member pursuant to this Agreement shall agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement as if they were a member from the inception of the DAO.

#### 5. Management.

> **(a)** Except as otherwise expressly required in this Agreement, the affairs of the DAO shall be carried on and managed exclusively by the Members, who shall have sole and absolute discretion with respect thereto. No Member shall be a manager, as defined under the Act.

> **(b)** Whenever any action, including any approval, consent, decision, determination, or resolution is to be taken or given by the Members or the DAO under this Agreement or under the Act, it shall be authorized by a vote of the Members via the Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces, unless otherwise provided herein. Such an authorization may be evidenced by a vote facilitated via the Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces and one or more smart contracts, or by a written consent, in accordance with this Agreement. The Members intend that any action (which has been duly approved in accordance with this Agreement) taken by the DAO via a Dapp, a smart contract, or the blockchain shall be a valid action of the Members or the DAO, as applicable, and no Member shall challenge the authority or validity of any such action based solely on such fact.

> **(c)** Except as otherwise expressly required in this Agreement or in the Act, no single Member (in their capacity as a Member) shall have authority to bind the DAO in any way or to enter into any agreement or contract obligating the DAO in any way unless approved via a vote occurring through the Dapp.

> **(d)** To the extent that the Members have approved a document in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Act, any Member can be expressly hereby authorized to execute and deliver such document on behalf of the DAO.

> **(e)** Members may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the Member with regards to the DAO pursuant to the Dapp.

> **(f)** The DAO has the right to delegate certain technical or administrative responsibilities to third parties and provide them with reasonable compensation.

Persons dealing with the DAO are entitled to rely conclusively upon the power and authority of the Members (and any Person to whom the Members delegated any such power and authority pursuant to this Agreement) and acknowledge that such Member or designee is authorized to act on behalf of the DAO and may bind the DAO or otherwise enter into a binding contract.

> **(h) Other Activities.** Each Member acknowledges and agrees that in addition to transactions specifically contemplated by this Agreement, and subject to applicable law, the Members, the DAO, and their respective Affiliates and Representatives are each hereby authorized to obtain property or obtain services from, to provide property or provide services to, or otherwise enter into any transaction with any Member, or any Affiliate or Representative of any of the foregoing Persons.

#### 6. Withdrawal Rights; Compulsory Withdrawal.

> **(a) Limited Right to Withdraw.** A Member may withdraw at any time by transferring its Tokens to a third party. Such withdrawal shall be facilitated and executed, in part, using one or more smart contracts and shall be effective as of the date of transfer. Any withdrawal is irrevocable. Alternatively, a Member may redeem the entirety of the Tokens held, which are submitted to the Juicebox Protocol and burned, reducing the DAO supply, in return the Member receives some portion of their initial or cumulative DAO Membership holdings in Ethereum (or other "Cryptographic currency"). A Member who burns the entirety of their token holdings shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the DAO. The DAO shall not be obligated to pay any interest or other compensation to a Member who redeems or withdraws its Tokens.

> **(b) Compulsory Withdrawal.** Not in limitation of Section 6(a), the Members acting by vote via the Dapp may cause a Member to be compulsorily withdrawn from the DAO to the extent that such Members, in their reasonable discretion, determine it to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate, including, without limitation, to comply with applicable law or regulations, or to avoid a material adverse effect on the DAO or the other Members. For the avoidance of doubt–the Member proposed to be compulsorily withdrawn shall be entitled to vote with respect to any vote of the Members regarding such compulsory withdrawal.

> **(c) Emergency Immediate Compulsory Withdrawal For Cause.** Not in limitation of Section 6(a), 6(b), any Member, in their reasonable discretion, determine it to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate, including, without limitation, to comply with applicable law or regulations, or to avoid a material adverse effect on the DAO or the other Members.

Any such assets not so disposed of shall be disposed of by a court of competent jurisdiction of the county in which the principal office of the corporation is then located, exclusively for such purposes or to such organization or organizations, as said Court shall determine, which are organized and operated exclusively for such purposes.

#### 10. Limitations on Transfers.

> **(a) Transfers.** Governance Rights and Tokens are not transferable, except to other members. Members may vote to allow or disallow the ability of Members to transfer their Governance Rights and/or Tokens by a vote facilitated via the Dapp. Tokens may become freely transferable to Ethereum addresses outside of the DAO ("External Addresses") by a vote of the Members. In the event the Tokens become freely transferable to External Addresses, you agree that holders of the External Address shall automatically be granted Membership rights, subject to this Agreement.

> **(b) Admission of Substituted Members.** If the transferee is not already a Member, any transferee of Tokens transferred in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be admitted as a Member. The DAO shall not recognize for any purpose any purported transfer of all or any part of a Member's interest or Tokens in the DAO, and no purchaser, assignee, transferee, or other recipient of all or any part of such Tokens shall become a Member hereunder unless:

> **(i)** The transferee of Tokens transferred pursuant to this Section that is admitted to the DAO as a transferee Member shall succeed to the rights and liabilities of the transferor Member with respect to such transferred Tokens.

> **(ii)** Effect of Death, Dissolution, or Bankruptcy. Upon the death, incompetence, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or dissolution of a Member, the rights and obligations of that Member under this Agreement shall accrue to that Member's successor(s), estate, or legal representative, and each such Person shall be treated as an unadmitted transferee of that Member's Tokens, as described in the Act.

The DAO shall not be obligated to keep any books or records beyond what is made available via the Dapp or available via the Ethereum blockchain.

#### 12. Waiver of Fiduciary Duties.

> **(a)** Except as expressly set forth in this Section, in the event that any Member initiates any Proceeding against the DAO and a judgment or order not subject to further appeal or discretionary review is rendered in respect of such Proceeding, as the case may be, such Member shall be solely liable for all costs and expenses related to the Proceeding.

> **(b)** Limitation by Law. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to provide for the indemnification for any liability to the extent (but only to the extent) that such indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but instead shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions thereof to the fullest extent permitted by law.

> **(c)** Waiver of Fiduciary Duties. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise of applicable law, including any in equity or at law, no Member shall have any fiduciary duty to the DAO or to any Member by reason of this Agreement or in its capacity as a Member, except that the Members shall be subject to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing and the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of the Members otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Members. Members will exercise any rights under this Agreement consistent with this Agreement.
