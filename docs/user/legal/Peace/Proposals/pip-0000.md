### Background

As the DAO has grown and matured, it has become necessary to formalize the process of ratifying the actions of the DAO, this is currently underway with the current governance proposal. However, in addition to the governance proposal, there are other prior terms, agreements, actions which require ratification by the DAO. Additionally, certain individuals and the service provider requires indemnification as they act on behalf of the DAO in various capacities, including establishing the legal entity, affiliate relationships, and the disbursing of Cryptocurrency funds.

### Ratifications

### Authorization for "Meatspace" Activities

The dao-lawfirm.eth, tankbottoms.eth, goodtimeswith.fuzzyhandcuffs.eth (Benjamin Reed) are engaged in IRL activities which include the drafting of the Terms of Service, Guiding Principals, and supporting governance documentation, as well as applying for banking accounts, EIN (entity identification number), and payment processors, additionally, prior to the DAO establishing its own on-off-ramp, certain conversion of funds to and from Ethereum, DAI, were necessary on personal accounts, therefore, the DAO should ratify to indemnify the individuals and service provider for any liability arising from these and other ongoing activities. Additionally, the DAO should ratify all prior actions taken by the aforementioned individuals and service provider including execution of any contracts or transferring of funds from the [PeaceDAO treasury](goodtimeswith.fuzzyhandcuffs.eth).

### Reserved PEACE

Certain current or planned individuals no longer participate with PeaceDAO from a day-to-day perspective and therefore should be removed from the PEACEDAO reserved-list, while other certain individuals have been involved with PeaceDAO from the beginning and should be added to the reserved PEACEDAO reserved-list in order to engage with governance beyond the NFT.
