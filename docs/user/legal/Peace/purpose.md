# Purpose

☮️ Our Mission and Core Values

### Our Goal

**Our goal is to ensure the ability of the earth to nurture life in all its diversity.**

That means we want to:
- **protect biodiversity** in all its forms.
- **prevent pollution** and abuse of the earth’s ocean, land, air and fresh water.
- **end all nuclear threats**.
- **promote peace**, global disarmament and non-violence.

### Our Core Values

**Personal responsibility and nonviolence.** We take action based on conscience. This means we are accountable for our actions and take personal responsibility. We are committed to peacefulness; everyone on a Greenpeace action is trained in nonviolence.

**Independence.** We do not accept money from governments, corporations or political parties. Individual contributions, together with grants from foundations, are the only source of our funding.

**Greenpeace has no permanent friends or foes.** If your government or company is willing to change, we will work with you to achieve your aims. Reverse course, and we will be back. What matters isn’t words, but actions.

**Promoting solutions.** It’s not enough for us to point the finger; we develop, research and promote concrete steps towards a green and peaceful future for all of us.
