# Governance Process

The experiment is to facilitate the DAO's governance with a large community expressed through voting NFTs.

#### Definitions

Some terms used in this document have specific meanings, and are defined in the [Definitions](./1.%20definitions.md).

## Phase 0: Discussion

Anyone with an idea and a single [governance NFT (_mainnet:0xdd407a053fa45172079916431d06E8e07f655042_)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd407a053fa45172079916431d06E8e07f655042)[^1] create a proposal discussion thread in the `#‚úçÔ∏èÔΩúproposal-workshop` channel of the [DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz). See [How to Create a Proposal](../proposals) for best practices. If interest is shown, the proposal is championed by an Author who will submit the proposal to Snapshot.

## Phase 1: Temperature Check

Once finalized, authors can submit their proposals to DAO's [Temperature Check Space](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth) as a basic, single-choice vote. The Temperature Check Space grants one vote to each MAPE holder. As the DAO's Service Provider, the [dao-lawfirm.eth](https://dao-lawfirm.xyz/) ensures that any malicious, bad actors, coordinated efforts to exploit governance loopholes are subject to a veto. After 45 days, proposals in this stage will be archived.

## Phase 2: Consensus

Each NFT[^1] corresponds to one vote in the Consensus Space.

**Every 28 days**, proposals with at least 10 "For" votes in the [Temperature Check Space](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth) are moved to DAO's [Consensus Space](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth) with the [Snapshot weighted whitelist strategy](https://snapshot.org/#/strategy/whitelist-weighted)[^2] which last **seven (7) days**. The whitelist is comprised of any Ethereum address which contributed ETH or DAI to the Gnosis Multi-Sig[^3] between February 2022 through July 2022, the weights are calculated simply by the USD value of the contribution. The aforementioned strategy can be found at the [signers](./5.%20signers.md#Whitelist-Weighted-Strategy) page. **Again, the DAO's Service Provider, the [dao-lawfirm.eth](https://dao-lawfirm.xyz/) is responsible for ensuring that any proposal abuses are subject to a veto.**

## Phase 3: Execution

Once the Consensus voting closes, proposals which receive more than **66% "For"** votes are queued for execution by the [multi-signature signers](./5.%20signers.md). _"Abstain" votes are not included in this calculation._

## Emergency Governance

In an emergency governance scenario, the [multi-signature signers](./5.%20signers.md) can take on-chain actions if _explicit public approval_ from **80 percent or more of [multi-signature signing](./5.%20signers.md) members** AND _explicit public approval_ from **dao-lawfirm.eth** is received. For the purpose of clarity, _explicit public approval_ means that the [dao-lawfirm.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x752515a3a1091b9f1c04416cf79d1f14d2340085) provides a summary of the proposed action and signed messages from the [multi-signature signers](./5.%20signers.md) by threshold in the DAO `#üìùÔΩúgovernance` channel of [Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz), although on-chain signing of the actual emergency transaction is sufficient.

As a courtesy, the DAO Service Provider expects that some type of proposal _a priori_ or _a posteriori_ is within the scope of its duties within **72 hours** of any action taken.
