## Thesis:

Pay MULTISIG-NAME (AMOUNT) DAI to pay for ~3 months of technical product development and community building.

## Motivation:

Currently, payout processes are opaque and invoke major overhead for contributors. A budget will allow the DAO to operate more efficiently and with greater transparency.

## Risks:

- These funds may not be ideally distributed.
- These funds may be more useful later on.
- The DAO is delegating major responsibility by approving a budget for 3 months, which increases risk.

## Specification:

The DAO and its advisors have reached a consensus that there will partner legal entities to provide form and discrete functions as the vision of an open treasury and governance application. The unincorporated non-profit DAO will service as outreach for those needs in public goods are unserved by the for-profit motives, the DAO will have non-exclusive rights to the intellectual property of the product.  Contributors to the DAO Gnosis will be eligible to receive membership tokens by which to participate in the governance of the DAO.

To service the needs of the product intellectual property the formation of DAOLABS, LLC was formed to retain the intellectual property developed to date and to engage with development staff to continue with the development of the product. The intellectual property will be licensed to DAOLABS, Inc a for-profit corporation which will execute the for-profit function of the product including the relationships with payment processor providers, cryptocurrency on-off-ramp providers, and other data services for which the product requires. Additionally, the DAOLABS, Inc will distribute options to individual contributors and stock to financial contributors including potential future investors.
