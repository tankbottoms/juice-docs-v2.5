## Thesis:

The DAO treasury should invest \$500,000.00 DAI into Ethereum, convert \$10,000,000.00 DAI into Compound Finance's collateralize DAI (cDAI) to earn interest at 0.67% APY, and convert 1,000 ETH into stETH to earn 3.9%.

## Abstract:

On August 9, 2022, USD/ETH was $1,775.348.

The DAO treasury holds the following assets:

| Asset |   Amount   | Amount in USD | Percentage of Total |
| :---: | :--------: | :-----------: | :-----------------: |
|  DAI  | 13,929,850 | \$13,909,166  |       85.58%        |
|  ETH  | 1,318.5573 | \$2,341,991.2 |       14.41%        |

Prior to June 18, 2022, the DAO had 869 ETH at an average acquired price of \$2,875.00. Between June 18, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the DAO acquired an additional \$450,000.00 worth of ETH between \$900.26 and \$1030.32 for a total of ETH 448.6697898 currently worth \$798,259.83, bringing the average cost per ETH to $2,122.89. The DAO is invested in the long term success of the Ethereum ecosystem and is willing to hold ETH for the long term.

## Motivation:

The DAO could earn interest on its assets by investing in Compound Finance's cDAI and cETH. The DAO has held the vast majority of its assets since February, 2022 and has not earned any interest to date. At a minimum the DAO should provide uncontroversial assets to protocols which have been mainstays of the Ethereum ecosystem, as well as staking in preparation for Ethereum 2.0.

## Risks:

The DAO could lose its assets if Compound Finance goes bankrupt.
The DAO could lose its assets if Ethereum fails as a platform.
