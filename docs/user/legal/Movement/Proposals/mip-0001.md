## Thesis

The [Initialization](../4a.%20Initialization.md) provides a background to common questions by new members. The [Code of Conduct](../3.%20code-of-conduct.md) is the baseline of expected behavior between the DAO members. The [Guiding Principals](../4.%20guiding-principals.md) follows the [Delaware Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c019/index.html), which provides the structure for the DAO and its members. The [Terms of Service](../8.%20tos.md) is the agreement the DAO makes with individuals who use our decentralized application. Finally, the [Governance](../7.%20governance.md) details the specific mechanics of how the members discuss, propose, and ratify proposals.

1. Ratify and adopt the [Code of Conduct](../3.%20code-of-conduct.md); and,
2. Ratify and adopt the [Guiding Principles](../4.%20guiding-principals.md); and,
3. Ratify and adopt the [Terms of Service](../8.%20tos.md); and,
4. Ratify and adopt processes for the [DAO multisig and DAO governance, based on NFT voting](../7.%20governance.md).

## Motivation

In order for the DAO to establish itself as a legal entity and limit liability with regards to the many uncertainties inherit to Cryptocurrencies and DAOs and the fluid community governance in which we are attempting to enable, it is necessary to ratify the Code of Conduct, Guiding Principles, and Terms of Service. The DAO must establish a governance process in order to enable the community to participate, adherence to the ethos of development in the open, and ultimately the ratification proposals. Great effort has been made to ensure that the documentation is both comprehensive, clear and brief, as well as, adhere to the law, the Delaware Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, U.S. Securities Act, U.S. Department of Treasury through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, common law and the dizzying areas of law in which Cryptocurrency intersects.

The DAO needs a governance process for the following:

-   Utilize treasury funds;
-   Respond to evolving market conditions;
-   Establish consensus for technical decisions;
-   Promote action-oriented discussion; and
-   Establish clear and transparent processes for the DAO's future and present actions.

## Specification

Ratify and adopt the following DAO processes:

-   [Code of Conduct](../3.%20code-of-conduct.md); and,
-   [Our Guiding Principles](../4.%20guiding-principals.md); and,
-   [Terms of Service](../8.%20tos.md); and,
-   [The Gnosis multi-sig and DAO governance, based on NFT voting](../7.%20governance.md).

Update the DAO's Communication and Voting Online Services:

-   [Snapshot DAO Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth); and,
-   [Snapshot DAO Ratification](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth); and,
-   [DAO's Discord server](https://discord.gg/movexyz); and,
-   [DAO's Documentation Website](https://docs.movedao.xyz/); and,
-   and other relevant resources to reflect these changes.

## Rationale

Governance Process:

-   encourage broad accessible participation; and,
-   promotes transparency and accountability; and,
-   legal, comprehensive, brief, clear; and,
-   minimize ambiguity, loopholes and abuse, and confusion; and,
-   leaves complexity to individual proposals; and,
-   allowing the DAO to be adaptable; and,
-   flexible, subject to amendment to meet the DAO's needs over time; and,
-   has safety mechanisms in place; and,
-   oversight by dao-lawfirm.eth; and,
-   optional emergency governance; and,
-   strives towards minimal disruption migrating to on-chain governance; and,
-   balances the needs of the DAO, non-profit, force for good and community; and,
-   clear legitimate, affiliate vehicle for profit; and,
-   does not intentionally centralize decision making.

Multisig Process:

-   is also simple and easy to understand, leading to similar benefits; and,
-   has safety mechanisms in place but does not overly centralize execution; and,
-   balances community participation, without sacrificing duty of care; and,
-   new members to be added through standard governance processes; and,
-   new multisig membership should expand over time.

## Risks

-   processes rely on sound distribution of NFTs and sound multisig membership; and,
-   poor decision making, unstructured feedback, lopsided participation; and,
-   uninformed opinions, unwillingness to compromise, learn, or adapt; and,
-   malicious behavior, or negativity superseding open discussions; and,
-   bias from concentrated sources, i.e. dao-lawfirm.eth or the initial signers multisig; and,
-   submitted proposals not well thought out, or not well received; and,
-   proposals could be executed in one (1) week, possibly too short; and,
-   proposals could take several (~3-4) weeks, taking more time though the governance stages; and,
-   this governance process has high thresholds, meaning only well-liked proposals will pass.
-   This process inherits the risks of democracy.

## Timeline

These processes should be implemented once this proposal passes a 3-day basic single-choice [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth), only to be removed when superseded or amended by another proposal.
