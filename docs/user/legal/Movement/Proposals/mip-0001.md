## Thesis

Ratify and adopt processes for the Movement DAO multisig and Movement DAO governance, based on MAPE token voting.

## Motivation

Although the MOVE platform is under technical development, Movement DAO needs a governance process in order to (among other things):

-   Utilize treasury funds.
-   Respond to evolving market conditions.
-   Establish consensus for technical decisions.
-   Promote action-oriented discussion AND
-   Establish clear and transparent processes for the DAO's future and present actions.

Ambiguity in the decision making process not only leads to confusion: it leaves those not part of the "inner circle" feeling disenfranchised.

## Specification

Ratify and adopt the [Movement Governance Process](https://move-docs.on.fleek.co/docs/dao/governance/) ([IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmRGs9i365KXDwmY5QHrgibcSDjXWnpimUbzD78VuA6Cyf) and the [Movement Multisig Process](https://move-docs.on.fleek.co/docs/dao/multisig/) ([IPFS](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWE5xGCiLhF2PAHL32kZ19X8YJ7CwFYtbny8KHgT1U9DY)).

Update Movement DAO's Snapshot servers ([1](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth) [2](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth)), [Discord server](https://discord.gg/movexyz), and other relevant resources to reflect these changes.

## Rationale

The Governance Process:

-   is simple, reducing ambiguity, loopholes, and confusion. This encourages participation.
-   takes place in public. It is transparent and promotes accountability.
-   leaves complexity to individual proposals, allowing the DAO to be adaptable. The process can be amended to meet the DAO's needs over time.
-   has safety mechanisms in place (the dao-lawfirm.eth veto + emergency governance) but does not centralize decision making.

The Multisig Process:

-   is also simple and easy to understand, leading to similar benefits.
-   has safety mechanisms in place (the dao-lawfirm.eth removal) but does not overly centralize execution. New members must be added through standard governance processes.

## Risks

-   These processes rely on sound distribution of MAPE NFTs and sound multisig membership.
-   Poor decision making, malicious behaviour, or bias from dao-lawfirm.eth or the multisig could prove disastrous. Over time, their power should be reduced. Multisig membership should expand over time.
-   Although some proposals could be executed a week after being written (at the minimum), others proposals may take 3 or more weeks to pass through all stages of governance.
-   This process has high thresholds, meaning only well-liked proposals will pass.
-   This process inherits the risks of democracy.

## Timeline

These processes should be implemented once this proposal passes a 3-day basic single-choice [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth), only to be removed when superseded or amended by another proposal.
