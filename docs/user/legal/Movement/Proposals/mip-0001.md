## Thesis

Ratify and adopt the [Code of Conduct](../3.%20code-of-conduct.md); and,
Ratify and adopt the [Guiding Principles](../4.%20guiding-principals.md) of the DAO; and,
Ratify and adopt the [Terms of Service](../8.%20tos.md) presented by the DAO to individuals accessing and using its DAPP; and,
Ratify and adopt processes for the [DAO multisig and DAO governance, based on NFT voting](../7.%20governance.md).

## Motivation

The DAO needs to establish a Code of Conduct for its members, the type of association and legal entity structure to adopt, the agreement between the DAO and users of its DAPP, viewers of the DAO's work product, and define how the DAO will govern itself.

The DAO needs a governance process for the following:

-   Utilize treasury funds;
-   Respond to evolving market conditions;
-   Establish consensus for technical decisions;
-   Promote action-oriented discussion; and
-   Establish clear and transparent processes for the DAO's future and present actions.

## Specification

Ratify and adopt the following processes:

-   [Movement Governance Process](https://move-docs.on.fleek.co/docs/dao/governance/); and
-   [Movement Multisig Process](https://move-docs.on.fleek.co/docs/dao/multisig/).

Update the DAO's Servers:

-   [Snapshot Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth);
-   [Snapshot Ratification](https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.movedao.eth); and
-   [DAO's Discord server](https://discord.gg/movexyz);
-   and other relevant resources to reflect these changes.

## Rationale

Governance Process:

-   is simple, reducing ambiguity, loopholes, and confusion. This encourages participation.
-   takes place in public. It is transparent and promotes accountability.
-   leaves complexity to individual proposals, allowing the DAO to be adaptable.
-   can be amended to meet the DAO's needs over time.
-   has safety mechanisms in place with the dao-lawfirm.eth veto and emergency governance.
-   does not centralize decision making.

Multisig Process:

-   is also simple and easy to understand, leading to similar benefits.
-   has safety mechanisms in place but does not overly centralize execution.
-   new members to be added through standard governance processes.

## Risks

-   These processes rely on sound distribution of NFTs and sound multisig membership.
-   Poor decision making, malicious behavior, or bias from dao-lawfirm.eth or the multisig.
-   Multisig membership should expand over time.
-   Proposals could be executed in a single governance cycle after being written (at the minimum), others may take more time to pass through all stages of governance.
-   This process has high thresholds, meaning only well-liked proposals will pass.
-   This process inherits the risks of democracy.

## Timeline

These processes should be implemented once this proposal passes a 3-day basic single-choice [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth), only to be removed when superseded or amended by another proposal.
