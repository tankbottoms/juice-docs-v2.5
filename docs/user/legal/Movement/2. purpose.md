The primary purpose of the DAO is to enable programmable community focused Ethereum (**"Cryptocurrency"**), fiat compatible, treasury applications **legally**[^1] at any scale openly on the blockchain. The DAO community collaborates with existing traditional and non-traditional organizations, and communities to build, deploy and maintain the DAO applications through existing coordination smart-contracts[^2] such as Gnosis multi-signature smart contracts (**"Gnosis"**), and Juicebox protocol compatible treasuries (**"Juicebox"**).

The **Juicebox protocol**, provides a framework for funding and operating projects **("Member Projects")** openly on Ethereum, which enables censorship resistent Cryptocurrency focused-treasuries. Juicebox protocol contracts allow communities to deploy an administrative NFT, programmable payment terminals for receiving Cryptocurrency (**"Contributions"**) and distributes funds (**"Payouts"**), project tokens (**"Project Tokens"**) for community membership, and employs funding cycles (**"Funding cycles"**) which are time-locked and enforce treasury constraints.

The DAO researches, develops, and maintains the legal framework to enable existing entities to either migrate or expand their treasuries to accept Cryptocurrency. The DAO develops Cryptocurrency wallet solutions to facilitate and simplify the on/off-boarding of Cryptocurrency for existing entities, enhance the management of Cryptocurrency wallets, Multi-signature wallets, and traditional banking, credit card information. The DAO enables Member Projects to create and deploy Crypto-native products directly integrated providing richer, sustainable, membership Contributions to thrive and scale.

The DAO oversees and manages the DAO's Endowment (**"Endowment"**) which funds the DAO applications, the DAO endowment capital, and seeds, or provides ecosystem grants as proposed by the application's core contributors (**"Core Contributors"**)[^3].

The combination of all these efforts together is the vision for the DAO.

In bullet point form, the DAO is developing the following application and features:

-   supporting the JuiceboxDAO and protocol community
-   built-in support for Cryptocurrency wallets, Gnosis, fiat, credit/debit card on-off-ramp
-   simplified multi-signature management interaction
-   legal structure governance document generation concurrent with treasury deployments
-   compatible with the Juicebox protocol, pass-through creation for certain Member Projects
-   diverse NFT product tooling for creators, membership communities alike
-   treasury diversification and token management
-   treasury, member projects, members reputation scoring and ranking
-   enable and foster public good, community focused projects
-   develop sustainable public, private good community models
-   develop sustainable endowment fund for member projects and Core Contributors
