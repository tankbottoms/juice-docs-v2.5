The primary purpose of the DAO is to enable programmable, community-focused, fiat-compatible, legally compliant[^1] Ethereum (**"Cryptocurrency"**) treasury applications which can operate at any scale, openly on the blockchain. The DAO community collaborates with traditional and non-traditional organizations and communities to build, deploy and maintain the DAO applications through coordination smart-contracts such as Gnosis multi-signature smart contracts (**"Gnosis"**), and Juicebox protocol compatible treasuries (**"Juicebox"**)[^2].

The Juicebox protocol provides a framework for funding and operating projects **("Member Projects")** openly on Ethereum, enabling censorship-resistant, Cryptocurrency-focused treasuries. Juicebox protocol contracts allow communities to deploy an administrative NFT, deploy programmable payment terminals for receiving Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, (**"Contributions"**), distribute funds (**"Payouts"**), deploy project tokens (**"Project Tokens"**) for community membership, by employing funding cycles (**"Funding cycles"**) which are time-locked and enforce treasury constraints.

The DAO researches, develops, and maintains the legal framework to enable informal associations and formal entities to migrate and/or expand their treasuries to accept Cryptocurrency. The DAO develops Cryptocurrency wallet solutions to facilitate and simplify the on/off-boarding of Cryptocurrency, enhance the management of Cryptocurrency wallets, Multi-signature wallets, traditional banking, and credit/debit card integration. The DAO enables Member Projects to create and deploy directly integrated and Crypto-native products, providing rich, sustainable opportunities for Member Projects and their Contributions to thrive and scale.

The DAO oversees and manages the DAO's Endowment (**"Endowment"**) which funds the DAO applications, manages the DAO's endowment capital, and seeds or provides ecosystem grants as proposed by the application's core contributors (**"Core Contributors"**)[^3].

The DAO's vision is the summation of these efforts.

In bullet point form, the DAO is developing an application which includes the following features and goals:

-   supporting JuiceboxDAO and the Juicebox protocol community
-   built-in support for Cryptocurrency wallets, Gnosis, traditional banking, credit/debit card on-off-ramps
-   simplified multi-signature management interaction
-   legal structure/governance document generation in conjunction  with treasury deployments
-   compatibility with the Juicebox protocol, pass-through creation for certain Member Projects
-   diverse NFT product tooling for creators and membership communities alike
-   treasury diversification and token management
-   reputation scoring and ranking for treasuries, member projects, and members
-   enabling and fostering public goods and community-focused projects
-   developing sustainable public/private good community models
-   developing a sustainable endowment fund for member projects and Core Contributors
