#### Mission.

JuiceboxDAO helps people confidently run programmable and community funded treasuries from startup to scale, openly on Ethereum.

#### Purpose.

The primary purpose of Juicebox DAO ("DAO") helps people confidently run programmable and community funded treasuries from startup to scale, openly on Ethereum. The DAO and its community build and maintain the **Juicebox protocol**, a framework for funding and operating projects ("Member Projects") openly on Ethereum. Its contracts allow communities to deploy an administrative NFT, programmable payment terminals for receiving ("Contributions") and distributing funds ("Payouts"), project tokens ("Project Tokens") for community membership, and funding cycles for time-locked and recurring constraintsâ€”all in powerful, customizable ways.

Features of the Juicebox protocol include:

- Funding Cycle automation and duration. The duration of time the configuration of the Member Project is active.
- Payouts. The fixed amount or percentage of cryptocurrency to distribute for each Funding Cycle per address.
- Project Token Issuance, or initial mint rate of Member Project Token. Possible values are 1 to 1,000,000.
- Reserved Tokens. The percentage of total Project Tokens withheld from distribution for the Contribution. Possible values are 0 to 100.
- Reserved Token allocation. The individual, entities which will receive Project Token from the Reserved Tokens allocation.
- Discount Rate. The percentage which the Token issuance will decrease each funding cycle. Valid values are between 0 and 20.
- Redemption Rate. The amount of overflow each Project Token may be redeemed for.
- Pause payments. When enabled, Member Projects cannot receive payments.
- Allow token minting. When enabled, Project Tokens can be issued at will.
- Reconfiguration rules, or Ballot. Conditions which must be met for a project to be reconfigured.

Juicebox treasuries can evolve over time, allowing people to launch open-ended projects and to adjust constraints, extensions, and incentives over time as needed. The protocol is light enough for a group of friends, yet powerful enough for a global network of anons sharing thousands of ETH, ERC-20s, or other assets ("Cryptocurrencies").

The DAO shall have the power to do any and all acts appropriate, convenient, desirable, incidental, or necessary to or in furtherance of the purposes described in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any and all of the powers that may be exercised on behalf of the DAO by its members. The DAO shall not engage in profit-making activities. Any profits that are incidentally accrued or earned from any of the DAO's activities will be used or set aside for the DAO's nonprofit purposes.
