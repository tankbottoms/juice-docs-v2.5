If the Juicebox Project (or DAO) does not intend to be a for-profit entity, this is a reasonable start in order to generally be unconcerned with the legal ramifications of contributions, redemption, secondary markets, and sales of nfts, reason is simply that all proceeds are distributed for the entity purpose, which specifically is not a profit seeking enterprise.
