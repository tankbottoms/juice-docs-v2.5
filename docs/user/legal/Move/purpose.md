##### Our Purpose

The primary purpose of the DAO is to develop programmable community focused Ethereum ("Cryptocurrency") treasury applications at any scale, openly on the blockchain. The DAO community collaborates with communities to build, deploy and maintain the DAO application. One such part of the treasury applications employs the **Juicebox protocol**, a framework for funding and operating projects ("Member Projects") openly on Ethereum. Its contracts allow communities to deploy an administrative NFT, programmable payment terminals for receiving ("Contributions") and distributing funds ("Payouts"), project tokens ("Project Tokens") for community membership, and funding cycles for time-locked and recurring constraintsâ€”all in powerful, customizable ways. DAO communities may receive Contributions, donations, sales, or facilitate a portion of their organization's access to capital on the blockchain, The DAO additionally develops on-and-off-ramps for fiat and existing financial infrastructure, accounting management tooling, and creator focused features to enable any type of lawful activity to native to Cryptocurrency or not.
