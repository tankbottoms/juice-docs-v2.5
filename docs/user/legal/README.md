## Introduction

Welcome to the Juicebox Legal Resources section. The process of filing a legal entity along side a DAO regardless of which parts you choose of either for governance is generally referred to as "wrapping". While the circumstances are all different, there exist cases for DAOs to operate across the legal spectrum from unincorporated non-profits, incorporate for-profits, or via different legal structure governed by entirely new agreements. Whichever direction you choose, the purpose here is to inform you of _some_ options, so that you may address these specific in whichever manner suits you. This section will discuss a number approaches existing projects took, the general legal entity landscape, and present information, some with reference, some with example agreements, all for you to make whichever decision you decide. While this section attempts to provide a foundation for basic understanding of the law, it does so minimally to segue into the materials provided. Ultimately, you will be the one responsible to make the right decision about your circumstances and how it relates to your project.

Please read the above highlighted disclaimers carefully and repeatedly. While the information provided may sound authoritative, competent, and somewhat researched, ultimately, this is information on the internet and is provided to you for informational purposes only, you should not rely on this information whatsoever. It is a given that the prior confidence instilling adjectives should be given little weight.

## Terminology

Throughout this Legal Reference section there are terms and descriptions of certain features of the Juicebox protocol on Ethereum.

> The primary purpose of **Juicebox DAO ("DAO")** helps people confidently run programmable and community funded treasuries from startup to scale, openly on Ethereum. The DAO and its community build and maintain the **Juicebox protocol**, a framework for funding and **operating projects ("Member Projects")** openly on Ethereum. Its contracts allow communities to deploy an administrative NFT, programmable payment terminals for **receiving ("Contributions")** and **distributing funds ("Payouts")**, **project tokens ("Project Tokens")** for community membership, and funding cycles for time-locked and recurring constraintsâ€”all in powerful, customizable ways.

How you configured your Member Project, including Payouts will affect the legal implications of your project, if any.

[^1]: The corporate formation agreements and trust templates have been provided by counsel and used commercially as well as the containing provisions therein defended in subsequent litigation.
