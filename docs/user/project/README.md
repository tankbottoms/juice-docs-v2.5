# Project Creation Guide

The Juicebox protocol is a framework for funding and operating projects openly on Ethereum. Its contracts allow communities to receive funds, issue tokens for community membership, and configure funding cycles to transparently utilize those fundsâ€”all in powerful, customizable ways.

To create a Juicebox Project, press 'connect' in the top right corner of the [homepage](https://juicebox.money) to connect your wallet. Next, click on 'Design your Project'. Configure your project on the left side of the project design wizard. The right side shows a project preview.

The NFT which represents your project will be minted to your wallet once you create your project. You can send this NFT to a multisig or another address if you would like to transfer your project's ownership.

:::tip
Consider creating a test project on the [Rinkeby testnet version of Juicebox](https://rinkeby.juicebox.money) before creating a mainnet project. If you need help deciding how to configure your project, ask in the [Juicebox DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox).
