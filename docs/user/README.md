# Intro

#### _Juicebox helps people confidently run programmable and community funded treasuries from startup to scale, openly on Ethereum._

![](/img/characters.png)

The Juicebox protocol is a framework for funding and operating projects openly on Ethereum. Its contracts allow communities to receive funds, issue tokens for community membership, and configure funding cycles to transparently utilize those fundsâ€”all in powerful, customizable ways.

Juicebox treasuries can evolve over time, allowing people to launch open-ended projects and to adjust constraints, extensions, and incentives over time as needed. The protocol is light enough for a group of friends, yet powerful enough for a global network of anons sharing thousands of ETH, ERC-20s, or other assets.
